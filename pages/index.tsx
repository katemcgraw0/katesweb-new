On the front end, I used React to ensure seamless and responsive client-side interactions, and on the server side, I implemented custom REST API enpoints, which used Flask to access my SQLite database. SQLite allowed the application to have the ability to handle real-time user interactions, including account creation, post publication, commenting functionality, an infinite scroll feature. This was the first time that I manually implemented security measures such as password salting and hashing techniques to safeguard passwords stored within the SQLite database, as previously I had used Google OAuth or other secure login tools to avoid writing vulnerable code. I didn't put as much work into the front-end of this project, as I was more focused on learning new back-end technologies, but I am excited to use these new technologies in my projects moving fowards!`,

This pager handles critical functions such as memory allocation, process switching, and page fault handling by maintaining virtual memory backed by swap space or files. The system uses a single-level page table and simulates memory management hardware, enabling complex memory operations like copy-on-write and eviction with a second-chance FIFO algorithm. This project emphasized efficient resource use and robust fault handling, and I developed extensive test cases to verify the pagerâ€™s functionality and performance.`,

      description: `I built a multi-worker and fault-tolerant MapReduce server in Python which can process user-submitted tasks. This project was a deep dive into distributed systems, aiming to implement a framework capable of executing MapReduce programs across a cluster of computers. Our framework comprised two main components: a Manager and multiple Workers. The Manager accepted user-submitted MapReduce jobs and distributed tasks among the Workers. Each Worker executed map and reduce tasks on the given data. The Manager ensured fault tolerance, task distribution, and system concurrency using OS-provided facilities such as threads and sockets for networking. One of the key challenges was ensuring efficient communication between the Manager and Workers while maintaining system robustness. We tackled this by implementing a reliable heartbeat mechanism, to monitor Worker status and reassign tasks if any Worker failed. To do this, we used UDP to send heartbeats and TCP for registration and ackowledgement communication. This experience not only strengthened my understanding of distributed systems but also enhanced my skills in Python programming, concurrency, and network communication`,

This project involved several key learning goals, including information retrieval concepts like text analysis using tf-idf, link analysis with PageRank, and parallel data processing using MapReduce. We built a segmented inverted index of web pages using MapReduce programs. This involved parsing, cleaning text, and calculating tf-idf scores. Our index server used a REST API that returns search results in JSON format. It loads inverted index segments, PageRank data, and stopwords into memory. Each server instance handles different index segments. For the search server, we created a user interface for querying the search engine. It aggregates results from multiple Index servers and displays the top 10 results. The UI includes a query input and a PageRank weight slider.
